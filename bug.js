In Next.js, an uncommon error arises when using server-side props (`getServerSideProps`) or static generation (`getStaticProps`) with dynamic routes and a data fetching mechanism that isn't properly handled for edge cases.  For example, if your data fetching function throws an error, Next.js might not gracefully handle it, leading to a cryptic 500 error without much information in the logs.  This is particularly true if the error occurs within a promise or async function, and the error isn't properly caught and reported.
