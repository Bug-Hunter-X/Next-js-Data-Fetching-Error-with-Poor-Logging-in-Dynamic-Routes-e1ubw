This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-debug, issue in Next.js applications involving data fetching within `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` functions for dynamic routes.  The bug showcases a scenario where an error during data fetching leads to a 500 error without sufficient logging details.  The solution provides a robust error handling mechanism using `try...catch` blocks and detailed error logging.
